# Facial-Expression-Recognition-using-CNN

This is my undergraduate first year Minor Group Project.
In this project, we tried to develop and train an Image Processing or Convolution Neural Network Model that can recognize Human face expressions  like whether a person happy, sad, neutral, surprise, disgust, fear or angry by just analyzing an image with human face. We used NumPy and OpenCV for preprocessing and Tensorflow and Keras frameworks to develop this model with Python as my primary programming language.
