# Facial-Expression-Recognition-using-CNN

In this project, I tried to develop and train an Image Processing or Convolution Neural Network Model that can recognize Human face expressions  like whether a person happy, sad, neutral, surprise, disgust, fear or angry by just analyzing an image with human face. I used NumPy and OpenCV for preprocessing and Tensorflow and Keras frameworks to develop this model with Python as my primary programming language.
